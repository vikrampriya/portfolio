			<p id="introduction">
				Last Summer I was fortunate enough to be a Summer intern at Microsoft. (Now, that in itself was an experience, and I urge you to take a look at my article detailing my experiences). The Summer was particularily interesting because I had the chance to develop two great apps that helped us get a better understanding of the Highlights and Pain Points facing developers who wish to develop on the new <a href="https://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop/building-universal-windows-apps">Universal Application Development Environment. </a>
			</p>

			<p id="introduction">In this article, I wanted to give you a quick idea of what the two applications did, so as to provide you with a better understanding of the sorts of work I did this last Summer.</p> 

			<h2 id="content-subhead"> Open States </h2>
		
			<p id="introduction">
				I developed the first application in order to get a better understanding of how difficult it would be to port an application from iOS to Windows. As such, I chose the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/open-states/id500672932?mt=8"> Open States iOS </a> application.
 			</p>

 			<p id="introduction">
 				The concept behind OpenStates was simple enough. The application pulls data from <a href="http://sunlightlabs.github.io/openstates-api/">Sun Light Labs, Open States API. </a> The data regarding Politicians, their constiuencies, and their policies, are then displayed to the user in the iOS app. 
 			</p>

 			<p id="introduction">
 				For my part, I developed a Universal Application using the <b>C# Programming Language</b> and the Universal Application Framework. The final product was then demonstrated to my team, and I wrote a report detailing my experiences. Unfortunately, the information contained in that report is not available for the public. 
 			</p>

			<h2 id="content-subhead"> Recipe Guide </h2>

			<p id="introduction">
				The second application was developed in order to test <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/"> Apache Cordova.</a> This absolutely wonderful tool allows developers to write one single application in <b>HTML/CSS and Javascript </b>, and then deploy that app on a wide variety of mobile and tablet form factors. 
 			</p>

 			<p id="introduction">
 				Recipe Guide, the application I built, simply got information from <a href="https://developer.yummly.com/"> Yummly </a> and displayed the information to the user. The actual application allowed users to have profiles, store favourite recipes, create grocery lists from recipies, and view the nutritional and taste information. I wrote the application using <b>HTML/CSS and Javascript </b> and deployed it on a variety of form factors, including multiple Windows phone devices, an iPhone, and an Android Tablet.
 			</p>
		
			<h2 id="content-subhead"> Looking Forward </h2>

			<p id="introduction">I am pleased to be returning back to Microsoft in the Fall to continue my work on improving the developer experience. I will be working with the Universal Applications Team as a Software Development Engineer in Seattle, WA. </p>

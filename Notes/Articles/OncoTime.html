			<p id="introduction">
				The OncoTime Programming language was designed by professor <a href="http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/~hendren/">Laurie Hendren</a> as a solution to problems faced by doctors in the Radiation Oncology laboratory at the <a href="http://muhc.ca/clinic/radio-oncology-clinic-mgh-radio-oncology">Montreal General Hospital.</a> The hospital had a program, wherein Doctor, Patient, and Diagnosis data was all stored in a <b>MySQl</b> database. The issue was that Doctors, not trained in programming or database querying, found it very difficult to access the data and information they needed. OncoTime acted as a solution. 
			</p>

			<p id="introduction"> 
				OncoTime is a general purpose, "wrapper" language that allows users to quickly write simply programs that will allow them access to the information they need, quickly, and efficiently. It was written in the <b>C Programming Language</b> using <a href="http://aquamentus.com/flex_bison.html">Flex / Bison</a> My team developed the <i>otc</i> OncoTime compiler which took OncoTime programs and created <b> Python </b> code that would access and display the results of the MySQL queries to the user.

			<p id="introduction">
				We are currently in the process of making the source code available unders and open source license. The idea being that we want everyone to have access to the OncoTime language, as well as allow intelligent developers to help us further develop the language. 
			</p>

			<h2 id="content-subhead"> Looking Forward </h2>
		
			<p id="introduction">
				We want to continue to develop and work on OncoTime. As such, I will be working with Laurie this summer to create a Web interface for OncoTime, wherein which potential users  <b> don't have to learn the language to get access to the data. </b> I think this will be a great step forward for OncoTime and for the users at the Hospital, who an continue to improve patient care by getting access to the information they need.

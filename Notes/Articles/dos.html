            <h2> 5 Things Every Developer Should Do </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="content">

			<h2 id="content-subhead"> (1) Read, Read, Read </h2>

			<p id="introduction">It's a little ironic that I should be writing this number 1 'do' because I switched from the Humanities to Computer Science because I was tired of reading. The fact remains though, that technology is always changing and evolving. We developers and engineers can't afford not to keep up with the latest developments and news. With respect to getting developer news, its as easy as spending 15 minutes on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">HackerNews</a> or <a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming">/r/Programming</a></p>

			<p id="introduction">It is also important the developers and engineers keep reading about what facinates them in their particular field. For example, I am very interested in Compiler Design, so I am currently making my way through <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Crafting-Compiler-Charles-N-Fischer/dp/0136067050"> Crafting a Compiler.</a> This way, not only am I staying passionate about my field, but I am also increasing my worth as a developer by increasing the knowledge I have.</p>

			<h2 id="content-subhead"> (2) Write, Write, Write </h2>	

			<p id="introduction">Know something not very many people know about? Share it with the world! Not only does writing (or abstracted, teaching) help solidify your own knowledge, you could be providing a resource that many people are looking for. Have you had a summer internship at a high profile company? Write about your experiences interviewing and working their. Did you work on a really cool project, using hot new technologies? Write about how those technologies worked and how your project worked. The possibilites are endless. </p>


			<p id="introduction"> Not only does writing help the reader, it also helps you. Imagine you were working on a project and didn't understand a topic. You found a great blog article explaining that topic clearly, and simply. Maybe you want the guy or gal who wrote that article on your team! This happens all the time, in a field where technical expertise are so highly valued, companies will work day and night to get developers who have shown their skills through blogs and other written sources. </p>

			<h2 id="content-subhead"> (3) Contribute to Open Source Code </h2>	


			<p id="introduction"> Much in the same light as the previous point, contributing to open source code is a great way to increase your knowledge as a developer, while simultaneously getting your name out there. If you contribute to a variety of projects you will quickly build experience that will help on the job. </p>


			<p id="introduction"> Moreoer, Open Source projects are a great way to contribute back to the community. The projects provide free services that thousands of people can use, irrespective of whether they are developers or not. You may even find that the deeper you get into the open source community, the more interesting projects you find. </p>

			<h2 id="content-subhead"> (4) Ask Questions </h2>	

			<p id="introduction"> if you don't understand something, ask someone who does. This conept is not overly difficult, but I find many developers will often be afraid of looking stupid or incompetent if they ask a question. It's important to know that <b>no project can be completed without help</b> and that <b>you are hurting the project by not asking questions and making assumptions</b> </p>

			<h2 id="content-subhead"> (5) Work in Teams </h2>	
			<p id="introduction"> Finally, it is important to recognize that no developer works by themselves. The idea that Comptuer Scientists are reclusive individuals who huddle away in dark basements working on technical projects is far flung from reality. You will find yourself working in teams more often then not, and only very rarely will you have a piece of code you wrote entirely by yourself. Work in teams, get used to working in teams, and learn what makes a team thrive.</p>

			<p id="introduction">You will be a better developer for it. </p>
